              <p>Southern Glazer’s Wine and Spirits (SGWS) was a premier account with Beverage Media Group. As a
                value-add, I worked with their Events Coordinators to create a ticket registration system over an
                eight-year span for both their New York City Wine & Food Festival (NYCWFF) and South Beach Wine & Food
                Festival (SOBEWFF) Trade Day tasting events. Each year, we expanded on the system to add more features.
                For these projects, I was the Product Manager, IU/UX Designer, Frontend Developer and Backend Developer.

            <div class="boxR overflow-auto lead" style="max-height: 200px">
              <p>The BevSites e-commerce platform, unlike other SaaS options like Shopify and BigCommerce, aimed to
                deliver a specific e-commerce solution for the the wine retailer. Every feature that was built was built
                with the beverage alcohol industry in mind.</p>
              <p>In my role as a frontend developer, my focus was on refining websites to enhance their visibility and
                performance on search engines. This involved implementing various SEO strategies. I also ensured a
                smooth user experience by creating a dedicated mobile version of the websites.</p>
              <p>My responsibilities extended to the realm of UI design and development, where I led the effort to
                create user-friendly interfaces while adhering to accessibility standards. I successfully coded default
                design templates for a substantial portfolio of over 250 e-commerce websites. A significant
                accomplishment was my work on developing a cutting-edge Solr-based faceted search system that gained
                industry recognition as the standard navigation tool for the beverage alcohol sector.</p>
              <p> I also played a pivotal role in translating intricate Photoshop designs into functional HTML layouts.
                My tasks included maintaining design standards, conducting quality assurance checks, and verifying
                cross-browser compatibility. In addition, I excelled in web administration tasks, seamlessly integrating
                frontend design with backend programming technologies such as Classic ASP, HTML, and CSS, and skillfully
                incorporating dynamic features using jQuery, JavaScript, and AJAX. This holistic approach ensured a
                cohesive user experience across all aspects of the platform.</p>

            <div class="boxL overflow-auto lead" style="max-height: 200px">
              <p>The checkout User Experience (UX) was hampered by older technology and retailers weren't checking out
                their carts. The system was in need of a new User Interface (UI) to go along with their updated UX. I
                coded the whole frontend system, from new HTML/CSS design templates to DOM manipulation with jQuery/JS.
              </p>
              <p><span class="fst-italic">Problem:</span> When adding to the cart, the whole page needed to be
                submitted, processed and rebuilt which put a large strain on server resources.</p>
              <p><span class="fst-italic">Solution:</span> Using AJAX, only a small bit of data was sent to the server.
                Once the server added the data to the order, a confirmation was returned and the cart numbers were
                updated. The buy button was changed to "ITEM ADDED" to indicate a successful submission. A tooltip was
                also added with a link to view the cart for quick access to the cart page.</p>
              <p><span class="fst-italic">Problem:</span> The old design had a word salad for various indicators and
                characteristics of the product.</p>
              <p><span class="fst-italic">Solution:</span> Use of icons with tool tips helped free of space and reduce
                visual clutter.</p>
              <p><span class="fst-italic">Problem:</span> The retailers were using the cart to hold products for review
                while they called their salesperson to actually place the order. At the time, there wasn't a way to
                separate placing orders for certain products or certain distributors so it was a pain to have multiple
                individual checkouts with only the products by distributor.</p>
              <p><span class="fst-italic">Solution:</span> In the redesign, I offered two views, a comprehensive view
                that separated the orders by distributor and a simplified view with a listing of all items that were in
                the cart.</p>
              <p>In the distributor view, I allowed the retailer to only checkout by distributor or all distributors. I
                allowed for further item level checkout by having the option to save for later. This would then skip the
                item during checkout submission.</p>
              <p>The all items view was just another compacted view based on the product, not the distributor, for
                easier product manipulation.</p>
              <p><span class="fst-italic fw-semibold">Result:</span> Saw an immediate 25% increase in checkouts compared
                to the previous version. The Average Order Volume (AOV) and Gross Merchandising Value (GMV) increased
                year after year. The site was the longest running B2B three-tier beverage alcohol ordering platform.</p>
